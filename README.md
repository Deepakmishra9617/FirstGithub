**Hello, I am Deepak Mishra!** 👋  
Welcome to my first GitHub project — *FirstGithub*! This repository contains my initial demo/web project built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## 🧠 About The Project

This is a beginner-friendly project demonstrating a simple web page. It includes:

✔️ A homepage (`index.html`)  
✔️ Basic UI components  
✔️ JavaScript functionality (`index.js`)  

This project is mainly for learning purposes and serves as my first step into GitHub. It helps me understand how repositories work and how to structure code on GitHub. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
